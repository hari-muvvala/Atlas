# Atlas – ATLAS Training Repository

This repository contains all my work from the ATLAS training program (Day 1 to Day 37).

## Repository Structure
- **trainer-tasks** → IntelliJ-based day-wise Java programs and tasks given during training.  
- **personal-notes** → Theory notes and day-wise documentation in DOCX format.  
- **self-learning** → Space reserved for additional practice and self-study beyond training.  
- **main** → Root branch with overall project information and repo index.

## Training Coverage
- Day 1 → Day 37 completed (final day of ATLAS training).  
- Includes Java basics, OOP, collections, multithreading, streams, file handling, exceptions.  
- Covers advanced topics: design patterns, SOLID principles, UML, generics, automation testing, DynamoDB, Mockito, JUnit, Selenium basics, ATLC.  

## Purpose
- Maintain a single structured repository of all training materials.  
- Keep programming tasks and theory notes organized day-wise.  
- Serve as a reference for revision, interviews, and future projects.
